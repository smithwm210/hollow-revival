# hollow-revival

A character-focused narrative RPG made in two weeks. Me and three classmates created this text-based fantasy adventure with simple team combat mechanics where you must take down a cult! We each developed a character quest for a party companion you meet along the way. Cierra O'Grady (cmogrady@wpi.edu) was the lead programmer and writer for Quent. Owen Pugh (orpugh@wpi.edu) wrote Cyril. Elijah Delcastillo (eedelcastillo@wpi.edu) wrote Eri. I was the lead designer and writer for Porter.
